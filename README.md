## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- *Docker* (for containerization)
  - To install Docker, follow the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
  
- *Git* (to clone the repository)
  - To install Git, follow the [official guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine.

  git clone https://github.com/UrvishSuhagiya/Expense_Tracker.git
  cd expense-tracker-django

### 2. Build the Docker Image
Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the project folder. In the root directory of the project, there is a Dockerfile that will help you create a Docker container.

Build the Docker image with the following command:

 - docker build -t expense-tracker-django .

This command will:

Create an image named expense-tracker-django using the instructions in the Dockerfile.
Install all the dependencies listed in requirements.txt (such as Django, Pillow, and Tkcalendar).
Set up the application.

### 3. Run the Docker Container
Once the image is successfully built, you can run the application with the following command:

- docker run -p 8000:8000 expense-tracker-django
  
This will:

Expose port 8000 on your local machine to port 8000 in the Docker container (the default port for Django's development server).
Start the Django application.

### 4. Access the Application
Now that the container is running, open your browser and go to:

- http://localhost:8000
  
You should see the home page of the Expense Tracker Django App.

### 5. Admin Access
To access the Django admin panel, you can use the following credentials:

Username: user
Password: user123

### 6. Database Migrations
If you haven't already applied migrations, you can run the following command to ensure your database is set up correctly:

- docker exec -it <container_id> python manage.py migrate

You can find the container_id by running:

- docker ps

### üê≥ Dockerfile Key Points:

Python Base Image: We use a slim version of the official Python 3.10 image to minimize the image size.
System Dependencies: We install system libraries such as tk for Tkinter (GUI support) and libsqlite3-dev for SQLite support.
Dependencies Installation: All Python dependencies are installed via pip using the requirements.txt file.
Expose Port: The container will expose port 8000 for the Django development server.
Migrations: The RUN python manage.py migrate command ensures that the database schema is up to date.
Start Django Server: The app is started using the Django development server (python manage.py runserver).
